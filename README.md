"# Heineken-dissertation" 


This repository contains the materials for my Heineken project - including code for predictive maintenance, natural language processing tasks and Pareto analysis. It also contains the code used to generate graphs. 

The "datasets created with Heineken data" folder contains a few datasets - including depalletiser and filler machinery datasets, and datasets after removing missing values etc. It also contains the datasets for cluster categories. This dataset was made with the intention so that when a script takes too long to process, the dataset can instantly run the code after.
