"# Heineken-dissertation" 


This repository contains the materials for my Heineken project - including code for predictive maintenance, natural language processing tasks and Pareto analysis. It also contains the code used to generate graphs. 

I did not include the dataset provided by Heineken as it is confidential material. However, this dataset can be provided with permission and if requested. There are also datasets I have created that were not included such as de-palletiser dataset and filler dataset, as these still contain confidential information.
